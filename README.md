# personal-website

Hello! This is a silly website I made to learn html and css. I made it have a lot of pink and cool formatting.  
You can see an about me page, past projects, current projects, and a 404 page with a picture that follows the mouse coursor (that doesn't work on firefox... for some reason...).
